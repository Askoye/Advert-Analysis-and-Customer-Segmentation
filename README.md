# Advert Analysis and Customer Segmentation - Week-13-IP

This repository contains two projects covering supervised and unsupervised learning with R

## Title
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in R 

## Author
Ted Askoye Samuel

## Project Description
1. Supervised Learning with R.

The aim of this project is to predict who is most likely to click on an online cryptography advertisement. The project contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the variables, identifying the characteristics of the individuals who clicked on the ad and using these characteristics to predict who is most likely to click on the ads. This project has applied four supervised learning algorithms i.e K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and the Random Forests.

2. Unsupervised Learning with R

The objective of this project is to perform clustering on different visitors to a website to identify which type of visitors are generating revenue and which visitors are not generating revenue. The steps followed include loading and checking the dataset, preparing the dataset for analysis and performing Exploratory Data analysis on the data and finally applying K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to the data with an aim to identify similarities or dissimilarities exhibited by different visitors to the website and grouping the visitors with similar characteristics together.
